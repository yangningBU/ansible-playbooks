# First Ansible Playground
I used Vagrant and Virtualbox to manage linux VMs locally, download links: [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

This project uses [make](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile) to simplify the ansible workflow. To see the most common commands simply type in
```
make
```
in the project root.

#### Setup
To get everything set up, just run
```
make setup
```

Then go checkout your running server on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and [localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443)
